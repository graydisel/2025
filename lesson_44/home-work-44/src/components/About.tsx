                    As a young man, William Deckard (Bill) had a dream to open his first Beer Distributor.  His roots
                are Northeast Philadelphia where he grew up, just minutes from the site of which would later become one of
                Philadelphiaâ€™s iconic beer distributors.  At age 21 he personally built the structure, secured a liquor
                license and opened his first store.  In 2011, a tornado struck the store causing Bill to shut down for a
                short period of time so that repairs could be made.  Fast forward a few years to present day and you will
                find Beer Hut to be one of the best beer distributors around.  We appreciate your loyalty and are privileged
                to serve you.
